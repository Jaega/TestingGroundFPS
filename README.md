This is an FPS game I created following along an online Unreal C++ tutorial


### Features ###

+ Infinitely generated levels, each with a random and unique terrain; more unpredicted challenges! (using garbage collection to create infinite illusion)
+ Randomly spawned AI enemies, which patrol through dynamically selected waypoints, search and attack automatically according to AI behavior tree
+ Night mode: detecting lights, infrared night vision, and aiming laser
+ Adjust character animations with different key bindings
